# GHIP

Hacking tools suite. The idea is to code individual tools that could be used in this suite and then integrate them.

## Blue Tools

- **zBounce:** Server management tool. Run commands on your proxy servers.

## Red Tools

- **zDB:** Scans the whole network for all existing exploits to compile them into a readable database.

- **zWiFi:** Currently in nightly. Automatically hacks all WiFi and compile a report.

- **exploitZ:** Automatic exploit of a target.

## Dev Tools

- **zCompile:** Compiles files into one before compiling. Helps organize the code and reuse it in other projects.

- **zLib:** A library of general purpose scripts such as parsers or display to import in all small projects to make them easy to integrate to the suite.
